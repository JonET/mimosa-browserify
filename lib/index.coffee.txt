#### Module Interface

# The code contained herein is all example code and shouldn't be used verbatim.
# The example in this case is modified from the mimosa-minify module.

"use strict"

# Pulling in the <a href="./config.html">configuration management</a> code that is a
# part of the module.

config = require './config'

# The registration function is the key part of your module.  This function is called
# during Mimosa's startup and it allows your module to bind to one or many steps
# in a Mimosa's workflow.
#
# The arguments passed in are:
#
# 1. mimosaConfig: The full mimosa-config including added flags to indicate what
# sort of Mimosa command is being run, and an added list of extensions being used by
# the application. You may decide based on the flags in the config to not register
# anything, which is fine. In the case of the minification example, if the isMinify
# flag isn't turned on then the minification module code isn't registered.
# 2. A register callback function which is used to inform what module function to call
# and under what circumstances to call it.
#
# The register callback function takes 4 parameters:
#
# 1. workflow types, an array of strings. Pick one-to-many types depending on the
# sort of task your module accomplishes. Possible values: preBuild, buildFile,
# buildExtension, postBuild, add, update, remove, preClean, cleanFile and postClean.
# 2. workflow step, a string. A workflow step for the selected workflow types.  For
# example, for the type 'update', you might choose to have your module code executed
# 'afterCompile', which makes sense for this example.  To help you figure out which
# step you might want to use, visit the <a href="http://mimosa.io/modules.html">modules</a>
# page on the website.
# 3. The callback function.  The code to be executed during a Mimosa workflow.
# 4. An optional array of extensions upon which to execute the callback. If the file or
# extension being processed doesn't match one of these extensions, the callback will
# not be executed. The extensions refer to the original extension of the file being
# processed, so 'coffee' for instance. The mimosaConfig object has an extensions object
# you can use to cover all of the desired extensions.  The extensions object has
# 4 properties: javascript, css, template, and copy. In the case of this example,
# javascript minification, you would want to use the extensions available in
# mimosaConfig.extensions.javascript so that your module would apply to all possible
# JavaScript variations. If no extensions are provided, Mimosa will send all files
# through the module.

registration = (mimosaConfig, register) ->
  e = mimosaConfig.extensions
  register ['add','update','buildFile'],      'afterCompile', _minifyJS, e.javascript
    #register ['add','update','buildExtension'], 'beforeWrite',  _minifyJS, e.template

# The _minifyJS function here represents your workflow callback function.  This function will be called
# during the workflow type and step you selected, if the file/extension being processed matches
# the registered extensions.  So given the example registration above, the _minifyJS function
# would be called after a JavaScript file is updated, during the 'afterCompile' step.  The 'compile' step is
# where, for instance, CoffeeScript is compiled to JavaScript, and you wouldn't want to minify CoffeeScript,
# so 'afterCompile' is appropriate.
#
# Your workflow callback is handed 3 arguments:
#
# 1. config: full mimosa-config enriched with all sorts of useful data beyond the default mimosa-config.
# 2. options: contains information about the asset(s) currently being processed.  Inside the options
# object is a 'files' array that is created early in the workflow. The array contains a list of file
# objects that are being processed. At different steps of the Mimosa workflow, those file objects are
# populated with the inputFileName, the outputFileName, the inputFileText, the outputFileText and some
# flags to indicate if the asset is a vendor asset, etc. The outputFileText is populated during the
# 'compile' step, so in the case of this example code, we'd want to run minification over each file in the
# files array, transforming the outputFileText to minified outputFileText.
# 3. next: a workflow callback. This callback must be called when your module has finished processing.  It
# tells Mimosa to execute the next step in the workflow.  If for some reason your module decides that
# processing for the current asset/build step needs to stop, the callback can be called passing false.
# Ex: next(false). In most cases you do not want to do this.

_minifyJS = (mimosaConfig, options, next) ->
  for file in options.files
    console.log file.outputFileText
    #file.outputFileText = minify(file.outputFileText)
  next()

# The registerCommand function is used to register new Mimosa commands. If this function is implemented
# Mimosa will call it during startup so the module has an opportunity to respond to the command line.
#
# registerCommand is passed 2 arguments:
#
# 1. program, a commander.js program object, read more here: http://visionmedia.github.com/commander.js/
# Use this object to create a command, the flags for it, any input values, the help text and the callback
# for the command.
# 2. retrieveConfig, a function, use retrieveConfig to have Mimosa execute a build and get the mimosa-config
# before a module's code is executed.  retrieveConfig takes two parameters, the first is a flag to indicate
# if a build is needed before module code is executed.  The second is a callback that should contain the
# module's functionality.  That callback is passed the mimosa-config.

registerCommand = (program, retrieveConfig) ->
  program
    .command('foo')
    .description("Do something fooey")
    .action ->
      retrieveConfig false, config ->

# The module.exports exposes module code to Mimosa.  The properties that
# are exported are Mimosa's hook to your module.  Mimosa will attempt
# to access functions that are placed into this exports matching these names:
#
# 1. registration: This function is called to bind your module to a Mimosa workflow.
# 2. registerCommand: This function is called to create a new Mimosa command.
# 3. defaults: This function is called to access the default configuration for your module.
# See <a href="./config.html">config.coffee</a>.
# 4. placeholder: This function is used to build a mimosa-config during 'mimosa new' and
# 'mimosa config'. See <a href="./config.html">config.coffee</a>.
# 5. validate: This function is called during Mimosa's startup to validate the mimosa-config.
# This is your module's opportunity to ensure the configuration it will be given later is
# valid. See <a href="./config.html">config.coffee</a>.
#
# Any other functions exported will be ignored by Mimosa, but may be useful to you if you have
# multiple modules that need to talk to one another.

module.exports =
  registration:    registration
